# CS 5620 Creative 2
Max Loetscher, Aaron Weiss

For creative 2, we have made a ray tracing engine, capable of constructing and
rendering scenes with point & ambient light, variable reflectivity, and 
texturing of objects with png files. Objects were created in Blender.

Sample scene of pyramids can be rendered by running 'python pyramids.py'.
